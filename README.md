# I4NG Hackathon 2025

**"Make it Digital" Pillar: CROss-National Online Survey (CRONOS) and The European Social Survey (ESS) Data Analysis for Policy Brief**

## üìå Project Overview

The project was developed as part of the [I4NG Hackathon 2025](https://infra4nextgen.com/events/save-the-date-hackathon-2/) and focuses on understanding what influences Europeans‚Äô confidence in digital fact-checking and how to strengthen these skills through policy recommendations.

## üìä Key Findings

-   Only **30%** of Europeans feel confident in their ability to verify online information.
-   **67%** of frequent internet users lack confidence in digital fact-checking.
-   Confidence is associated with:
    -   Ability to find product/service information online
    -   Digital privacy skills: cookie restriction and social media profile access control
    -   Trust in scientists (positive effect)
    -   General trust in others (negative effect)

## üß† Policy Recommendations

1.  **Mirror Online Shopping Behaviors**\
    Design fact-checking training that mimics familiar digital consumer habits.

2.  **Integrate with Digital Privacy**\
    Combine fact-checking education with privacy tools and practices.

3.  **Clarify Trust Boundaries**\
    Emphasize the difference between real-world trust and online information trust.

4.  **Support Academic Communication**\
    Train scholars to share evidence-based knowledge in accessible ways.
